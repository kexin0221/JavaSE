  <p>Nene is training her team as a basketball coach. Nene's team consists of $n$ players, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th player has an <span class="tex-font-style-it">arm interval</span> $[l_i,r_i]$. Two players $i$ and $j$ ($i \neq j$) can pass the ball to each other if and only if $|i-j|\in[l_i+l_j,r_i+r_j]$ (here, $|x|$ denotes the absolute value of $x$).</p>
  <p>Nene wants to test the cooperation ability of these players. In order to do this, she will hold several rounds of assessment.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>In each round, Nene will select a sequence of players $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_m$ such that players $p_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ can pass the ball to each other for all $1 \le i &lt; m$. The length of the sequence $m$ can be chosen by Nene. Each player can appear in the sequence $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_m$ multiple times or not appear in it at all.</li>
   <li>Then, Nene will throw a ball to player $p_1$, player $p_1$ will pass the ball to player $p_2$ and so on... Player $p_m$ will throw a ball away from the basketball court so it can no longer be used.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As a coach, Nene wants each of $n$ players to appear in at least one round of assessment. Since Nene has to go on a date after school, Nene wants you to calculate the minimum number of rounds of assessment needed to complete the task.</p>

  <p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^5$). The description of test cases follows.</p>
  <p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^6$)&nbsp;— the number of players.</p>
  <p>The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ ($1\leq l_i\leq r_i\leq n$)&nbsp;— the arm interval of the $i$-th player.</p>
  <p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot 10^6$.</p>

  <p>In the first two test cases, Nene can host two rounds of assessment: one with $p=[1]$ and one with $p=[2]$. It can be shown that hosting one round of assessment is not enough, so the answer is $2$.</p>
  <p>In the third test case, Nene can host two rounds of assessment: one with $p=[1,3]$ and one with $p=[2]$. Player $1$ can pass the ball to player $3$ as $|3-1|=2 \in [1+1,3+3]$. It can be shown that hosting one round of assessment is not enough, so the answer is $2$.</p>
