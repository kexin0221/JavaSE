  <p>The magical girl Nene has an $n\times n$ matrix $a$ filled with zeroes. The $j$-th element of the $i$-th row of matrix $a$ is denoted as $a_{i, j}$.</p>
  <p>She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Type $1$ operation: choose an integer $i$ between $1$ and $n$ and a permutation $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ of integers from $1$ to $n$. Assign $a_{i, j}:=p_j$ for all $1 \le j \le n$ simultaneously.</li>
   <li>Type $2$ operation: choose an integer $i$ between $1$ and $n$ and a permutation $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ of integers from $1$ to $n$. Assign $a_{j, i}:=p_j$ for all $1 \le j \le n$ simultaneously.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j}$. She asks you to find the way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more than $2n$ operations.</p>
  <p>A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).</p>

  <p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$). The description of test cases follows.</p>
  <p>The only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$)&nbsp;— the size of the matrix $a$.</p>
  <p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n^2$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

   Output
  </div>
  <p>For each test case, in the first line output two integers $s$ and $m$ ($0\leq m\leq 2n$)&nbsp;— the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of operations in your solution.</p>
  <p>In the $k$-th of the next $m$ lines output the description of the $k$-th operation:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>an integer $c$ ($c \in \{1, 2\}$)&nbsp;— the type of the $k$-th operation;</li>
   <li>an integer $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$)&nbsp;— the row or the column the $k$-th operation is applied to;</li>
   <li>a permutation $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ of integers from $1$ to $n$&nbsp;— the permutation used in the $k$-th operation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only should use no more than $2n$ operations. It can be shown that the maximum possible sum can always be obtained in no more than $2n$ operations.</p>

  <p>In the first test case, the maximum sum $s=1$ can be obtained in $1$ operation by setting $a_{1, 1}:=1$.</p>
  <p>In the second test case, the maximum sum $s=7$ can be obtained in $3$ operations as follows:</p>

  </center>
  <p>It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the matrix larger than $7$.</p>
